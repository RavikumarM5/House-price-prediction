🏠 House Price Prediction with Linear Regression 📈

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! 🏡💰

This repository contains a powerful machine learning model implemented in Python using linear regression. It's designed to predict house prices based on various features, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the location. 📏🛏️🌍

🔍 Features:
Uncover the secrets behind house prices by exploring the impact of different factors:
- Size of the house: Discover how square footage influences the price.
- Number of bedrooms: Find out how the number of bedrooms affects the value.
- Location: Explore how different areas contribute to the price variations.

📊 Model Training:
Witness the magic of linear regression as the model learns from historical data:
- Historical dataset: Dive into a rich dataset containing information about houses, their features, and corresponding prices.
- Linear regression: Unleash the power of this algorithm to establish a direct relationship between the input features and house prices.
- Coefficients and intercept: Watch as the model learns the coefficients and intercept that define the linear equation, enabling accurate predictions.

💡 Model Usage:
Put the model to work and make accurate predictions on unseen data:
- Predictive power: Experience the model's ability to calculate the predicted price based on the learned coefficients and the linear equation.
- Real-world applications: Imagine the possibilities of using this model to estimate house prices and make informed decisions.

📈 Evaluation:
Measure the model's performance and accuracy using essential metrics:
- Mean squared error (MSE): Assess the closeness of the predicted prices to the actual prices.
- Strive for excellence: Aim for a lower MSE, indicating higher accuracy and a better fit between predictions and reality.
